chatmup: Chat Mode Unproto Packet

This is an amateur radio application.

This app uses 'beacon' to send UI/unproto mode
mode packets in linux for use in unproto mode nets
or general CQ type chatting on packet radio.

this program is useful if you use this in one tmux pane and
in another tmux pane run "sudo axlisten 0 -art"
to view the traffic flowing through the ax25 radio port
Or, use ax25spy -bt

You can use multiple digis separated by space to widen the chat network
